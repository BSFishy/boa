# boa

boa is a language i am currently designing. not yet at the stage of
implementation, but just working through how the language will work from the
design perspective. things like how apis should look and function, standard
library, language features, etc.

at this point in time, this repo is purely for notes and experimentation with
what the language looks like. eventually, i'll get to the point where i
implement it, which will most likely be in this repo, but for now it's just
design and notes.

also, the name `boa` is a placeholder for now. i cant really think of a name
that i really like, but boa popped into my head the other day, so i'll stick
with it until i come across something that feels better to me.
